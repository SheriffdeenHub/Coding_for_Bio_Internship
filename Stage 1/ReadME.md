The Stage 1 of the HackBio internship requires us to write codes for 4 functions:

1. First, there is a function for translating DNA to protein

2. A function that simulates and generates a logistic population growth curve. Our function is able to generate a population curve of Population Size vs Time. It includes 2 extra parameters that randomize the length of the lag phase and the exponential phase.
   
3. The 3rd function was used to determine the time to reach 80% of the maximum growth; usually the carrying capacity
   
4. Lastly, a function code was written for calculating the hamming distance between the team members' Slack username and X handle.
